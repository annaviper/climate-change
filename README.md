# Is the ice melting?
  
Analysis of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, temperature and ice extent in the poles.

## Ideas and hypothesis
  
* Are the CO2 levels in the atmosphere increasing? And the temperature?
* Is there a correlation between the temperature and CO2 trend?
* Are the ice sheets melting and there is a difference between hemispheres? Is there a correlation between the ice sheets behaviour and CO2 and temperature?

> Null hypothesis: The carbon dioxide and temperature have no effect on the ice sheet extent.  
> Alternative hypothesis: The carbon dioxide and temperature have an effect on the ice sheet extent.
  
## Datasets source

The three datasets are from Kaggle: 
  
[Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere](https://www.kaggle.com/ucsandiego/carbon-dioxide)  
Seasonally Adjusted CO2 Fit: ppm
  
[Earth Surface Temperature](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data#GlobalTemperatures.csv)  
All temperatures are in the Celsius scale.
      
[Sea ice extent](https://www.kaggle.com/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data)  
Extent: 10^6 sq km
