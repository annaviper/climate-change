# Ideas and hypothesis
  
* Are the CO2 levels in the atmosphere increasing? And the temperature?
* Is there a correlation between the temperature and CO2 trend?
* Are the ice sheets melting and there is a difference between hemispheres? Is there a correlation between the ice sheets behaviour and CO2 and temperature?

> Null hypothesis: The carbon dioxide and temperature have no effect on the ice sheet extent.  

> Alternative hypothesis: The carbon dioxide and temperature have an effect on the ice sheet extent.
