# Is the ice melting?
  
First project of the Data Analytics bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona.
  
## Project description
   
This project was designed to practice data wrangling, plotting, statistical analysis and getting insights from the information in  datasets. The topic chosen is the melting of the poles and their relation with the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and global temperature.
  
## Questions to answer

* Are the CO2 levels in the atmosphere increasing?
* Is there a correlation between the temperature and CO2 trend?
* Are the ice sheets melting and there is a difference between hemispheres? is there a correlation between the ice sheets behavious and CO2 and temperature?
