# Is the ice melting?


## Project description

This project is made to practice data wrangling, plotting, statistics and getting insights from the information in the datasets. The topic chosen is the melting of the poles and their relation with the CO2 in the atmosphere and temperature.


## Questions to answer

* Are the CO2 levels in the atmosphere increasing?
* Does the temperature follow the CO2 and temperature trends?
* Are the ice sheets melting? Is there a difference between hemispheres?
* Can we find any correlation?
